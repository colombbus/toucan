TOUCAN Installation
-------------------

1°) Copy all files into a directory on your web server (e.g. "toucan")

2°) Ensure the rewrite engine of the web server is on
(e.g. on Apache, make sure that in apache.conf
'LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so' is uncommented)

2°) Edit .htaccess file: replace [YOUR_PATH] with the relative path of toucan 
(e.g. "/toucan/")

3°) Edit file application/config/config.php, replace [YOUR_PATH] with the
absolute path to toucan (e.g. "www.mysite.com/toucan/")

4°) Ensure that the php user has write permission over directory "media/public" and
its subdirectories

5°) Create a database and import file "toucan.sql" to build the required tables

6°) Edit file application/config/database.php, write your parameters to access
the database (database type, host, username, password, database name).

7°) Open the toucan page in a web browser: you should see the installation
screen, which will perform environment tests. If problems are detected, follow
instructions to solve them. There are 2 main steps:
Step 1: Installation of framework kohana
Step 2: Configuration of the Toucan application
(if Step 1 tests are ok, you will directly jump to Step 2)

8°) Remove files install.php, INSTALL.txt and toucan.sql

9°) (optional) To enable emails, you have to set connection parameters in
file application/config/email.php

Requirements
------------

Toucan uses the Kohana framework, which requires the following:

1°)Basic Requirements

Kohana will run in almost any environment with minimal configuration. There are
a few minimum server requirements:

1.Server with Unicode support
2.PHP version >= 5.2.3
3.An HTTP server. Kohana is known to work with: Apache 1.3+, Apache 2.0+,
lighttpd, and MS IIS
4.A SQL server: MsSQL, MySQL, MySQLi or PostgreSQL

2°) Required PHP Extensions

1. PCRE must be compiled with –enable-utf8 and –enable-unicode-properties for
UTF-8 functions to work properly.
2. iconv is required for UTF-8 transliteration.
3. mcrypt is required for encryption.
4. SPL is required for several core libraries.

3°) Recommended PHP Extensions

1. mbstring will dramatically speed up Kohana's UTF-8 functions. However, note
that the mbstring extension must not be overloading PHP's native string functions!
